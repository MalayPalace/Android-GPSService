# Android-GPSService
GPS Tracker creates a service which in turn will implement Location Listener (Android API to use GPS), and since itâ€™s a service, it will keep on running in a background. So irrespective of any GPS app is running or not, GPS will keep on searching for satellite even when you close any GPS app.
